# Lesson 7

Design is all about making decisions. In this lesson we will cover the importance of design studies.

## Design Studies

**Design studies** comprise of a series of scale models. By definition, a design study is a rigorous and systematic evaluation fo the factors that influence a design. A study will include relevant criteria, metrics, threshold, and a comparison of various possible approaches.

## Design Spaces

**Design spaces** explore a space of possibilities. Aesthetic and objective factors should be examined.

## Teaching And Learning

Design cannot be taught. Instead design must be learned from doing.

## Projects

Each of the projects involves solving a design problem in several ways. The solutions will be evaluated in a systematic way through a design study.

## Experiments

Design studies include experiments which are usually referred to in this class as an empirical scientific experiment. The overall goal for these experiments is repeatability.

## Report

A design study is presented in a report. The report should be professional in quality.

## Context

Context provides background and motivation for the study. We can provide context by defining any specialized vocabulary necessary.

## Research Questions

Research questions should examine the tradeoffs between various non-functional requirements. Each of these questions should be formulated in a neutral fashion.

## Subject

A design study should compare multiple subjects where each subject should be briefly described.

## Experimental Conditions

A software design study normally means running several versions of a program, making measurements and evaluating the results. Experimental conditions describe the environment in which the study will take place.

## Variables

Variables must be identified and appropriate metrics specified. Variables describe both independent and dependent variables, the units of measure, and how the research questions address them. Regarding variables, design studies and reports should include a summary table with three columns.

## Method

Methods include the number of trials, measurement devices and tools, randomization technique, significant digits, etc. The method should include an explicit statement of which subjects will be run and the arguments used as well as briefly describe any statistical techniques used.

## Results

The point of conducting a design study is to produce data. The results presents the data collected and their statistical analysis.

## Discussion

The discussion is opportunity to interpret the data you collected and provide a discussion of its implications. It also allows you to reflect on the experimentation itself.

## Conclusions

The conclusion section is where results are summarized and conclusions are drawn. You should provide explicit answers to the research questions you raised in the second section.

## Deliverables

Each project has three deliverables:

- Source code solving a specific problem in several ways
- A project report containing project-specific content
- A design study

## Wrap Up

In summary, design can't be taught. It has to be learned. Therefore, the projects will help build knowledge in the design area.
