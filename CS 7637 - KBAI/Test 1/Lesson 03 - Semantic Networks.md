# Lesson 3

In this lesson we will be covering the following topics:

- Knowledge representations
- Semantic networks
- Problem solving with semantic networks
- Represent and reason

## Representations

Knowledge of representation has two elements:

1. The language
2. The content

E.g., `F = m*a` is an algebraic equation representing Newton's second law.

## Introduction To Semantic Networks

There are several steps to constructing a semantic network:

1. Label each element
2. Label the relationship between each element
3. Label the relationship between initial and final state for each element

## Structure Of Semantic Networks

There are several elements for the structure of semantic networks:

1. Lexically: nodes
2. Structurally: directional links
3. Semantically: application-specific labels

## Characteristics Of Good Representations

What are some characteristics of good representations?

- Explicit relationships
- Natural constraints
- Abstraction (at the proper level)
- Precise details (no extraneous details)
- Transparent, concise, complete, fast, and computable

## Guards And Prisoners Problem

Many names for this problem (cannibals and missionaries, etc.), originally appeared in the 1200-year-old text _Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes_. Used throughout AI for problem representation. For more information see:

> Amarel, S. (1968). On representations of problems of reasoning about actions. Machine intelligence, 3(3), 131-171.

## Connections

The correspondence problem: given two situations, what object in one situation corresponds to what object in another situation?

Recall that the emphasis so far as been on the relationships between objects. For cognition in general, the focus is always on relationships.
