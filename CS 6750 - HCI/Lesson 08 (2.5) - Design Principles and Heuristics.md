# Lesson 8

In this lesson we cover design principles, specifically the following:

1. Don Norman's Six Principles
2. Constantine's and Lockwood's Six Principles
3. Nielsen's Ten Heuristics
4. Seven Principles of Universal Design

- **Discoverability** - relevant function should be made visible so the user can discover them as opposed to having to read about them in some documentation or learn them through some tutorials

There is often tension between discoverability and simplicity. One argues to be seen and on argues to keep the interface simple, a balance between these two is often required.

- **Simplicity** - use of design is easy to understand, regardless of user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level

- **Affordances** - the design of the thing affords or hints at the way it's suppose to be used

Signifiers are meant to close the gap between the affordance of an object (how the object suggests it should be used) and the perceived affordance (what the user thinks on how the object should be used).

- **Mapping** - refers to creating interfaces where the design makes it clear what the effect will be when using them (this is different than affordances where affordances suggests how to use objects)

- **Perceptibility** - refers to the user's ability to perceive the state of the system

- **Consistency** - we should be consistent both within and across interfaces to minimize the amount of learn the user needs to do to learn our interface; in this way we create affordances on our own

- **Flexibility** - wherever possible, we should support the different interactions in which people engage naturally, rather than forcing them into one against their expertise or against their preference

- **Equity** - complementary to flexibility, helping all users have the same user experience

- **Ease and comfort** - the design can be used efficiently an comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue; appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility

- **Structure** - we should organize our user interfaces in ways that helps the user's mental model match the actual content of the task

- **Constraints** - preventing the user from putting an input that wasn't going to work anyway

Norman's four types of constraints:

1. Physical
2. Cultural
3. Semantic
4. Logical

How do we deal with constraints? There are two ways:

- **Tolerance** - users shouldn't be at risk of causing too much trouble accidentally
- **Feedback** - user should be informed on why the error happened and how to avoid it in the future

One last heuristic regarding user error:

- **Documentation** - even though it's better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large
