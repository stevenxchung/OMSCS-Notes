# Lesson 10

In this lesson, we will look into two methods for task analysis:

1. Human information processor models
2. Cognitive task analysis

## GOMS Model

A human information processor model; it builds off the processor model of the human's role in a system. There are four categories in the GOMS model:

1. Goals
2. Operators
3. Methods
4. Selection rules

This model proposes that a human has a set of _goals_ and _methods_ they can choose from to accomplish those goals. Each method is comprised of a series of _operators_ which help carry out that method. Lastly, they use some set of _selection rules_ to help decide what method to choose from.

## Strengths And Weaknesses Of GOMS

Weaknesses of GOMS model:

1. Does not address complexity
2. Assumes user is an expert

Strengths of GOMS model:

1. Formalize user interaction

## 5 Tips: Developing GOMS Models

1. Focus on small goals
2. Nest goals, not operators
3. Differentiate descriptive and prescriptive
4. Assign costs to operators
5. Use GOMS to trim waste

## GOMS to Cognitive Task Analysis

The GOMS model assumes the human is an input-output machine (processor model). However, human reasoning may be too nuanced and complex to be so simplified.

Cognitive task analysis is another way of examining tasks but it puts a much higher emphasis on things like memory, attention, and cognitive load (predictor model).

## Cognitive Task Analysis

Cognitive task analysis are concerned with the underlying thought process associated with performing a task. Most methods follow a particular common sequence:

1. Collecting preliminary knowledge
2. Identify knowledge representations
3. Apply focused knowledge elicitation methods
4. Analyze and verify data acquired
5. Format results for intend application

## Hierarchical Task Analysis

This form of task analysis helps us understand what tools might already be available to accomplish certain portions of our task, or how we might design certain things to transfer between different tasks and different contexts.

Hierarchical task analysis strengths:

1. Abstracting out unnecessary details for a certain level of abstraction
2. Modularizing designs or principles so that they can be transferred between different tasks or different contexts
3. Organizing the cognitive task analysis in a way that makes it easier to understand and reason over

## Cognitive Task Analysis Strengths And Weaknesses

Like the GOMS model, cognitive task analysis also have strengths and weaknesses.

Strengths:

1. Emphasizes mental processes
2. Formal enough to for interface design

Weaknesses:

1. Time-intensive
2. May deemphasize context
3. Ill-suited for novices
