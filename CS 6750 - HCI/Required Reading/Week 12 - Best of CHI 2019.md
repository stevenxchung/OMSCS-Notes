# Week 12

> Ten questions on each test will be based on these readings. From the perspective of the test, your emphasis in reading these papers should be in getting a sufficient understanding of the material to answer high-level questions about the paper, as well as to be able to find answers quickly for more specific questions.

## A Framework For The Experience Of Meaning In Human-Computer Interaction

> Mekler, E. & Hornbæk, K. (2019). A Framework for the Experience of Meaning in Human-Computer Interaction. In Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. ACM.

Topic: presenting a framework to evaluate _meaning_ in HCI.

Meaning may be used as a non-modifying term to indicate a general sense of purpose, significance, or coherence.

Three aspects of meaning:

1. **Ontology** - concerns our relationship to the objects in the world, from which meaning can be constructed
2. **Inter-subjectivity** - is about the sharing of meaning, in a sense, that different people can come to shared understanding about the world and each other, despite not having access to each other’s mental states
3. **Intentionality** - concerns the relationship between action and meaning

> The key idea of the framework is that the experience of meaning consists of five distinct, albeit related components – connectedness, purpose, coherence, resonance, and significance

Assumptions:

1. We focus on meaning as a moment-to-moment experience
2. The framework conceptualizes meaning as a chiefly subjective experience
3. Despite its vast and seemingly abstract nature, the experience of meaning is not ineffable

## Touchstone2: An Interactive Environment For Exploring Trade-Offs In HCI Experiment Design

> Eiselmayer, A., Wacharamanotham, C., Beaudouin-Lafon, M., & Mackay, W. (2019). Touchstone2: An Interactive Environment for Exploring Trade-offs in HCI Experiment Design. In Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. ACM.

Topic: a direct-manipulation interface that is able to generate and examine trade-offs.

Interviewed participants highlighted the following problems in designs:

1. Time constraints
2. Weighing design alternatives
3. Counterbalancing problems
4. Representing experiment designs
5. Power analysis to select sample size

> Primary goal is to improve the quality and reproducibility of HCI experiments by offering researchers a tool for specifying and comparing alternative experiment designs.

## Online Grocery Delivery Services: An Opportunity To Address Food Disparities In Transportation-Scarce Areas

> Dillahunt, T., Simioni, S., & Xu, X. (2019). Online Grocery Delivery Services: An Opportunity to Address Food Disparities in Transportation-scarce Areas. In Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. ACM.

Topic: online grocery delivery services to serve low-resource areas.

Main research questions:

1. Does the online grocery-delivery model serve as a feasible model to provide healthy-food access to low-income and transportation-scarce individuals?
2. Does an online grocery-delivery service lead to healthier-food choices?
3. What opportunities exist for online grocery delivery service design to support healthy choices among individuals living in low-income and transportation scarce environments?

Researchers used structural coding to quickly access relevant data from their data set.

> We found that the service not only provided participants with access to healthy food but that our Shipt group purchased a higher percentage of healthy grocery items overall

## “They Don’t Leave Us Alone Anywhere We Go”: Gender And Digital Abuse In South Asia

> Sambasivan, N., Batool, A., Ahmed, N., Matthews, T., Thomas, K., Gaytán-Lugo, L., Nemer, D., Bursztein, E., Churchill, E., & Consolvo, S. (2019). “They Don’t Leave Us Alone Anywhere We Go”: Gender and Digital Abuse in South Asia. In Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. ACM.

Topic: focuses on online abuses, specifically cyberstalking, impersonation, and personal content leaks.

- About 72% of research participants reported that they faced online abuse - - Abuse tends to occur more for participants who were younger and from disadvantaged communities
- Consequences of online abuse vary widely from threats to murder and there were many examples given in the paper
- Victims of online abuse typically create their own coping mechanism (e.g., limiting social media, seeking help from family, etc.) rather than seeking support from law enforcement (law enforcement in Asia are inconsistent and not transparent)
- There are opportunities to help these victims however. Some of the solutions are to create more consistent social platforms which are flexible enough for victims to use. This could mean more privacy and content options along with options for reporting abuse

## Risk Vs. Restriction: The Tension Between Providing A Sense Of Normalcy And Keeping Foster Teens Safe Online

> Badillo-Urquiola, K., Page, X., & Wisniewski, P. (2019). Risk vs. Restriction: The Tension between Providing a Sense of Normalcy and Keeping Foster Teens Safe Online. In Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. ACM.

Topic: keeping foster teens safe online while enabling them to use the internet.

Research questions:

1. According to parents, what types of risks do foster youth encounter online?
2. How do foster parents attempt to mediate these online risks? Are these strategies effective?
3. What are the unique challenges associated with parental mediation of technology use in the home for foster families?

Researchers found 53% of foster teens in sample were considered high-risk.

Researchers propose several approaches for addressing challenges:

1. Training and educational programs to teach foster parents about the latest technology trends and about effective digital parenting practices
2. New policies that give foster parents more authority to use an array of possibilities to mediate technology use in the home
3. Design parental control software that is uniquely tailored to foster families

## ‘Think Secure From The Beginning’: A Survey With Software Developers

> Assal, H. & Chiasson, S. (2019). ‘Think secure from the beginning’: A Survey with Software Developers. In Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. ACM.

Topic: real issues of security appear to steam from a lack of organizational or process support to handle security throughout development tasks.

Research questions:

1. How does security fit in the development life-cycle in real life?
2. What are the current motivators and deterrents to developers paying attention to security?
3. Does the development methodology, company size, or adopting Test-Driven Development (TDD) influence software security?

Use of TDD was found to be most influential to influence software security.

> Dealing with competing priorities, and the lack of security plans, procedures, knowledge, or resources are the main causes for deferring security.
