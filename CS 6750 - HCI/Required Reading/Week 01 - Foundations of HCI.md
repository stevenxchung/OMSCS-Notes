> Ten questions on each test will be based on these readings. From the perspective of the test, your emphasis in reading these papers should be in getting a sufficient understanding of the material to answer high-level questions about the paper, as well as to be able to find answers quickly for more specific questions.

## Chapter 1: Historical Context

Book focuses mainly on research (what, why, and how).

- **User study** - in this book refers to an experiment with human participants
- HCI emerged in the 1980s, the discipline most central to HCI is _human factors_ or _ergonomics_
- **Vannevar Bush** - had ideas about storing and accessing information like what we are currently able to do with the internet
- **Sketchpad** - the first _direct manipulation_ interface
- **Douglas Engelbart** - invented the mouse in 1963
- **Xerox Star** - novel feature of the _desktop metaphor_
- **SIGCHI** - Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (1982)
- **The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction** - written by Card, Moran, and Newell; connects low-level human processes with interactions humans have with computers
- **MHP** - _model human processor_
- **KLM** - _keystroke-level model_

## Chapter 1: The Psychopathology Of Everyday Things

Two of the most important characteristics of good design are _discoverability_ and _understanding_.

- **Industrial design** - the professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer
- **Interaction design** - the focus is upon how people interact with technology. The goal is to enhance people’s understanding of what can be done, what is happening, and what has just occurred. Interaction design draws upon principles of psychology, design, art, and emotion to ensure a positive, enjoyable experience
- **Experience design** - the practice of designing products, processes, services, events, and environments with a focus placed on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience
- Design is concerned with how things work, how they are controlled, and the nature of the interaction between people and technology
- **Human-centered design (HCD)** - an approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving
- Discoverability results from five fundamental psychological concepts: _affordances_, _signifiers_, _constraints_, _mappings_, and _feedback_; there is also another more important principle called _conceptual model_ of the system
- **Affordances** - are the possible interactions between people and the environment; some affordances are perceivable, others are not
- **Percieved affordances** - often act as signifiers, but they can be ambiguous
- **Signifiers** - signal things, in particular what actions are possible and how they should be done; signifiers must be perceivable, else they fail to function
