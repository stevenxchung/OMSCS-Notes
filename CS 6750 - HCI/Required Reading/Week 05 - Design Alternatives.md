# Week 5

> Ten questions on each test will be based on these readings. From the perspective of the test, your emphasis in reading these papers should be in getting a sufficient understanding of the material to answer high-level questions about the paper, as well as to be able to find answers quickly for more specific questions.

## Brainstorm, Chainstorm, Cheatstorm, Tweetstorm: New Ideation Strategies For Distributed HCI Design

> Faste, H., Rachmel, N., Essary, R., & Sheehan, E. (2013, April). Brainstorm, Chainstorm, Cheatstorm, Tweetstorm: new ideation strategies for distributed HCI design. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (pp. 1343-1352). ACM.

Topic: brainstorming is more than the pooling of “invented” ideas, it involves the sharing and interpretation of concepts in unintended and (ideally) unanticipated ways. Ideation, in short, is the radical redistribution of ideas to “unconventionalize” a given context.

Effective brainstorming:

1. Criticism is ruled out - adverse judgment of ideas must be withheld until later
2. “Free-wheeling” is welcomed - the wilder the idea the better; it is easier to tame down than to think up
3. Quantity is wanted - the greater the number of ideas, the more the likelihood of useful ideas
4. Combination and improvement are sought - in addition to contributing ideas of their own, participants should suggest how ideas of others can be turned into better ideas; or how two or more ideas can be joined into still another idea

Limitations of brainstorming:

1. Production blocking
2. Evaluation apprehension
3. Free riding

Structuring ideation:

1. Face-to-face brainstorming
2. Nominal idea generation sessions
3. Computer mediated ideation

Model for group ideation:

1. Prompting
2. Sharing
3. Selecting
4. Committing

- **Cheatstorming** - no new ideas are necessary for further ideation to occur

## Chapter 6: The Process Of Interaction Design

> Rogers, Y., Sharp, H., & Preece, J. (2011). Chapter 6: The Process of Interaction Design. In Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction. John Wiley & Sons.

Topic: how to design and build interactive products.

Main points:

1. Consider what _doing_ design involves
2. Ask and provide answers for important questions about the interaction design process
3. Introduce the idea of a life cycle model to represent a set of activities and how they are related
4. Describe some life cycle models from software engineering and HCI and discuss how they relate to the process of interaction design
5. Present a life cycle model of interaction design

### What Is Interaction Design About

Interaction design is about allowing users' concerns to direct the development vs technical concerns.

### Four Basic Activities Of Interaction Design

Below are four basic activities of interaction design:

1. Identifying needs and establishing requirements
2. Developing alternative designs that meet those requirements
3. Building interactive versions so that they can be communicated and assessed
4. Evaluating them

### Key Characteristics Of The Interaction Design Process

1. Focus on users
2. Specific usability and user experience goals
3. Iteration

### How Do You Generate Alternative Designs

Looking at others' designs provides useful inspiration and encourages designers to consider alternative design solutions, which is key to effective design.

### Life Cycle Models: Showing How The Activities Are Related

The term _life cycle model_ is used to represent a model that captures a set of activities and how they are related.

## Observations On Concept Generation And Sketching In Engineering Design

> Yang, M. C. (2009). Observations on concept generation and sketching in engineering design. Research in Engineering Design, 20(1), 1-11.

Topic: concept generation examined via brainstorming, morphology charts and sketching. Correlations were found between the quantity of morphological alternatives and design outcome. The volume of dimensioned drawings generated during the early-to-middle phases of design were found to correlate with design outcome, suggesting the importance of concrete sketching, timing and milestones in the design process.

Exploring three hypotheses:

1. The quantity of concepts generated at the beginning of a design project correlates with design outcome
2. The quantity of sketches generated during a project correlates with its design outcome
3. Increased sketching at the beginning of the project, rather than at the end, correlates with better design outcome

Method: taking sample data from various courses (three courses with data taken from multiple years as well) and comparing concept generation techniques versus results of the course project for each of the courses. Morphology charts were created in all three courses. Paper-based design logbooks were kept by each student over the life of the project.

Results: A total of 4,008 sketches were counted in the logbooks. 61.4% included dimensions and the remaining 38.6% did not.

1. Results vs hypothesis 1: hypothesis holds true for shorter duration projects but not for longer duration projects
2. Results vs hypothesis 2: no statistically significant correlations were found between the total quantity of either dimensioned or total sketches of any type and final grade or contest ranking for the three courses
3. Results vs hypothesis 3: the proposed hypothesis is shown to be true. In addition, the role of milestones in planning design work may be important, and falling behind in design is linked to poorer outcomes

Conclusion: Concept generation measured in the form of morphology charts showed a statistically significant correlation with both project and final term grade in the introductory course. However, morphology charts in the advanced courses did not show a statistically significant correlation.
