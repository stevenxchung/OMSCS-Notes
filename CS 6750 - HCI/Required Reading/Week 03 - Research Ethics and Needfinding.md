# Week 3

> Ten questions on each test will be based on these readings. From the perspective of the test, your emphasis in reading these papers should be in getting a sufficient understanding of the material to answer high-level questions about the paper, as well as to be able to find answers quickly for more specific questions.

## Chapter 4: Scientific Foundations

What is research? There are three different definitions:

1. An exercise as simple as careful or diligent search
2. Collecting information about a particular subject
3. Investigation or experimentation aimed at the discovery and interpretation of facts and revision of accepted theories or laws in light of new facts

In HCI research we don’t prove things; we gather facts and formulate and test evidence.

Research, according to the third definition, involves discovery, interpretation, and revision.

Research has a critical purpose: to extend, refine, or revise the existing body of knowledge in the field; this is achieved through publication.

Though citations the body of research takes shape, the insights and lessons from early research inform and guide later research.

Research must be reproducible. The reproducibility standard enforces a process for conducting and writing about the research that ensures sufficient detail is included to allow the results to be replicated.

Engineers and designers create products that strive to bring together the best in form (design emphasis) and function (engineering emphasis). Engineers work in a world where the focus is on designing complete systems or products whereas research tends to be narrowly focused. Research tends to be small in scope where results are incremental not monumental. While a prototype is used to access alternatives in product development, a researcher's prototype is an early mock-up of an idea which is unlikely to directly appear in a product.

Tim Brown CEO of IDEO design firm on prototypes:

> Prototypes should command only as much time, effort, and investment as are needed to generate useful feedback and evolve an idea. The more “finished” a prototype seems, the less likely its creators will be to pay attention to and profit from feedback. The goal of prototyping isn’t to finish. It is to learn about the strengths and weaknesses of the idea and to identify new directions that further prototypes might take

While engineers and designers strive to build better systems or products, in the broadest sense, researchers provide the raw materials and processes engineers and designers work with.

Various definitions of empirical research:

1. Originating in or based on observation or experience
2. Relying on experience or observation alone, often without due regard for system and theory
3. Capable of being verified or disproved by observation or experiment

Three common research methods in HCI which are empirical:

1. Observational method:
   - Encompasses a collection of common techniques used in HCI research; this qualitative approach tends to achieve relevance while sacrificing precision, in HCI, this is the why or how of the interaction, as opposed to the what, where, or when
   - Includes interviews, field investigations, contextual inquiries, case studies, field studies, focus groups, think aloud protocols, storytelling, walkthroughs, cultural probes, etc.
2. Experimental method:
   - The scientific method, is where knowledge is acquired through controlled experiments conducted in laboratory settings
   - The relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable is one of cause and effect; cause-and-effect conclusions are not possible in research using the observational method or the correlational method
3. Correlational method:
   - Involves looking for relationships between variables, provides a balance between relevance and precision
   - Characterized by quantification since the magnitude of variables must be ascertained
   - Data may be collected through observation, interviews, on-line surveys, questionnaires, or measurement
   - Data obtained using correlational methods are circumstantial, not causal

Tips for finding an interesting research topic:

1. Think small
2. Replicate
3. Know the literature
4. Think inside the box

Some terms from this section:

- **User study** - an experiment in HCI
- **Empirical research** - encompassing both experimental and non-experimental methodologies
- **Facts** - the building blocks of evidence and is what we seek in experimental research
- **Theory** - a hypothesis assumed for the sake of argument or investigation; becomes a scientifically accepted body of principles that explain phenomena once confirmed through research
- **Law** - more specific, constraining, formal, and binding; a relationship or phenomenon that is invariable under given conditions
- **Fitt's law** - body of work originally in human motor behavior that is widely used in HCI; includes equations for predicting the time to do point-select tasks
- **Archived** - research paper is added to the collection of related work accessible to other researchers throughout the world; this is the final step in publication
- **Patent** - is also a publication, describes previous related work (prior art), how the invention addresses a need, and the best mode of implementation
- **H-index** - the most accepted single measure of the impact of a researcher's publication record
- **Controlled experiment** - requires at least two variables: a manipulated variable and a response variable
- **Manipulated variable** - typically a property of an interface or interaction technique that is presented to participants in different configurations (also known as an independent variable)
- **Response variable** - a property of human behavior that is observable, quantifiable, and measurable (also know as the dependent variable)
- **Usability evaluation** - involves accessing a single user interface for strengths and weaknesses (not controlled) whereas a user study is controlled
- **Internal validity** - is the extent to which an effect observed is due to the test conditions
- **External validity** - is the extent to which experimental results are generalizable to other people and other situations
- **Ecological validity** - refers to the methodology (using materials, tasks and situations typical of the real world), whereas external validity refers to the outcome (obtaining results that generalize to a broad range of people and situations)

## Survey Research In HCI

> Müller, H., Sedley, A., & Ferrall-Nunge, E. (2014). Survey research in HCI. In J. Olson & W. Kellogg (Eds.) Ways of Knowing in HCI (pp. 229-266). New York: Springer.

Surveys do not allow for observation of the respondents’ context or follow-up questions.

When used appropriately, surveys can help inform application and user research
strategies and provide insights into users’ attitudes, experiences, intents, demographics, and psychographic characteristics.

Surveys are appropriate for obtaining:

1. Attitudes
2. Intent
3. Task success
4. User experience feedback
5. User characteristics
6. Interactions with technology
7. Awareness
8. Comparisons

Researchers should avoid using surveys when trying to obtain:

1. Precise behaviors
2. Underlying motivations
3. Usability evaluations

Questions to avoid during need-finding:

1. Board questions
2. Leading questions
3. Double-barreled questions
4. Recall questions
5. Prediction questions

Cognitive pretesting is conducted such that the researcher can identify disconnects between their own assumptions and how respondents will read interpret, and answer questions. The pretest could be as follows:

1. “Read the entire question and describe it in your own words.”
2. “Select or write an answer while explaining your thought process.”
3. “Describe any confusing terminology or missing answer choices.”

During the data preparation and cleaning process, research should look out for the following:

1. Duplicate responses
2. Speeders
3. Straight-liners and other questionable patterns
4. Missing data and break-offs
5. Low inter-item reliability
6. Outliers

During analysis of open-ended comments, the researcher may prepare descriptive statistics such as a frequency distribution of codes, conduct inferential statistical tests, summarize key themes, prepare necessary charts,and highlight specifics through the use of representative quotes.

Similar to other empirical research, it is important to:

1. Describe the original research goals and the used survey methodology
2. Include detailed description of the survey methodology (this will explain other variables such as population being studied, etc.)
3. Discuss how the respondents compare to the overall population

Some terms from this section:

- **Survey** - method of gathering information by asking questions to a subset of people, the results of which can be generalized to the wider target population
- **Random sampling** - considered the gold standard because every person in the sampling frame has an equal, nonzero chance of being chosen for the sample
- **Confidence level** - indicates how likely the reported metric falls within the margin of error if the study were repeated
- **Satisficing** - occurs when respondents use a suboptimal amount of cognitive effort to answer questions
- **Acquiescence bias** - When presented with agree/disagree, yes/no, or true false statements, some respondents are more likely to concur with the statement independent of its substance
- **Social desirability** - occurs when respondents answer questions in a manner they feel will be positively perceived by others
- **Confidence interval** - represents the estimated range of a population’s mean at a certain confidence level
- **Linear regression** - indicates the proportion of variance in a continuous dependent variable that is explained by one or more independent variables and the amount of change explained by each unit of an independent variable
- **Coding** - used to organize and transform qualitative data from open-ended questions to enable further quantitative analysis
- **Bottom-up approach** - teh data is coded according ot categories identified by reading and re-reading responses to the open-ended question. has the benefit of capturing categories the researcher may not have thought of before reading the actual comments
