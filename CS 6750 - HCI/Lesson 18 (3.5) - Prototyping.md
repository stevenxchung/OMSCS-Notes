# Lesson 18

This lesson will cover the following topics:

1. **Prototyping** - looking at the different ideas available to us and developing them
2. Low-fidelity prototypes - things that can be assembled and revised very quickly for rapid feedback from users
3. High-fidelity prototypes - wire frames or working versions of our interface

## Basics Of Prototyping

Some basics to prototyping:

1. Early prototyping - rapid revision on preliminary ideas
2. Late prototyping - finishing touches on final design

Different prototype representations from early (low-fidelity) to late (high fidelity):

1. Verbal
2. Paper
3. Wizard of Oz
4. Wireframe
5. Physical
6. Functional
7. Live

Prototype evaluation from early to late:

1. Function
2. Interface
3. Performance

Prototype scope from early to late:

1. Horizontal prototype - covers the design as a whole but in a more shallow way
2. Vertical prototype - great detail on a small portion of the interaction

Summary of concepts:

1. Representation
2. Fidelity
3. Evaluation
4. Scope

## Tradeoffs In Prototyping

We must note tradeoffs in prototyping:

1. Low-fidelity prototypes:
   - Pros: easy to create and modify
   - Cons: not as effective for detailed comprehensive evaluations
2. High-fidelity prototypes:
   - Pros: can be used for detailed feedback and evaluation
   - Cons: difficult to actually put together

Remember that we are designing to get more feedback.

## 5 Tips: Prototyping

1. Keep prototypes easy to change
2. Make it clear that it's a prototype
3. Be creative
4. Evaluate risks
5. Prototype for feedback

## Types Of Prototypes

Below are different types of prototypes:

- **Verbal** - describing the design we have in mind to our user
  - _Social desirability bias_ can occur so we need to make sure to ask for specific and critical feedback
  - _Expert blind spot_ can also occur so we can use analogies to explain prototypes
- **Paper** - drawing our our design
  - We can utilize _card-based prototyping_ where each screen is on a different card and can be used to simulate the interaction
- **Wizard Of Oz** - a prototype where the user can now interact authentically with the system while a human supplies functionality that has not be implemented yet
- **Wire framing** - using more detailed tools to mark up what an interface might look like
- **Physical** - a 3D prototype on the interface but does not have to be the actual working version

## Design Life Cycle Revisited

We do not just move to the evaluation stage after we are done with prototyping, rather a single prototype corresponds to a single iteration through the cycle.

## Multi-Level Prototyping

All prototypes do not have to be at the same level at the same time. Instead, prototyping can and should exist at multiple levels of fidelity.
