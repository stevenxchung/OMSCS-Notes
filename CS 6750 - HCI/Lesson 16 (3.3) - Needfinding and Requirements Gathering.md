# Lesson 16

In this lesson we will look into:

1. Defining questions about the user
2. Generating answers about the user
3. Formalizing models of the user

## Data Inventory

Before doing need-finding there is a list of questions which are useful to keep in mind:

1. Who are the users?
2. Where are the users?
3. What is the context of the task?
4. What are their goals?
5. What do they need?
6. What are their tasks?
7. What are their subtasks?

## The Problem Space

We also need to identify the problem space:

1. Where is the task occurring?
2. What else is going on?
3. What are the user's explicit and implicit needs?

## User Types

As we consider the problem space we also should get an idea of the space of the user i.e., we want to understand who we are designing for.

## Avoiding Bias In Need-finding

Below are five tips in avoiding bias during need-finding:

1. Confirmation bias
2. Observer bias
3. Social desirability bias
4. Voluntary response bias
5. Recall bias

## Naturalistic Observation

Below are five tips to use during observation:

1. Take notes
2. Start specific, then abstract
3. Spread out your sessions
4. Find a partner
5. Look for questions

## Hacks And Workarounds

- **Hacks** - are ways users get around the interface to accomplish their tasks
- **Errors** - slips or mistakes that users frequently make while performing the task within the interface

## Interviews

Five quick tips for conducting effective interviews:

1. Focus on the six W's (who, what, when, where, why, and how)
2. Be aware of bias
3. Listen
4. Organize the interview
5. Practice

## Surveys

Here are five tips for designing an effective survey:

1. Less is more
2. Be aware of bias
3. Tie them to the inventory
4. Test it out
5. Iterate

## Writing Good Survey Questions

How do we write good survey questions?

1. Be clear
2. Be concise
3. Be specific
4. Be expressive
5. Be unbiased
6. Be usable

## Defining The Requirements

The final step for need-finding is to define our requirements. These are the requirements that the interface must meet. They should be specific and capable of being evaluated.

## Conclusions

Need-finding is how you develop your understanding of the needs of your user. We have discussed many different approaches from low-intervention to high-intervention:

Low-intervention need-finding:

- Naturalistic observation
- Participant observation

Mid-intervention need-finding:

- Errors and hacks
- Surveys, interviews, and focus groups

High-intervention need-finding:

- Ethnography

## Section Quizzes

### Exercise: Interviews

_Which of these would make good interview questions?_

- _How often do you exercise?_
- _What, if anything, do you listen to while exercising?_
- _What device do you use to listen to something while exercising?_

### Exercise: Surveys

_What is wrong with this survey?_

- The first question should have ordered the preferences from either 1 to 5 or 1 to 10 to give the user more options, and the user does not know what the numbers in between mean
- The second question is doing a bad job by leading the survey, it should have an option for those who do not like to exercise
- The third question is almost the same problem as the first question, the scale is also reversed
- The last question is too binary and needs to be more open-ended

### Design Challenge: Need-finding for Book Reading

_Take a moment and design an approach to need-finding for people reading on their own._

1. First we will think about data inventory (the six W's)
2. Where are people reading on their own?
3. What kind of users read on their own? What is the typical age range of users?
4. Come up with a survey and based on the survey results follow up with an interview
5. Iterate on surveys and interviews, we can also add in other methods to collect user data
