# Lesson 11

In this lesson we will look into the four models of context surrounding HCI:

1. Distributed cognition
2. Social cognition
3. Situated action
4. Activity theory

## Distributed Cognition

Distributed cognition suggests models of cognition should be extended outside the mind. An example is you can either add large numbers in your head (much more difficult) or add large numbers on a piece of paper. Each object in the the process can be said to extend the cognitive process.

## How A Cockpit Remembers Its Speeds

Given the dynamic nature of flight, how does a cockpit remember its speeds?

The paper references to a cockpit and not one individual component as the cockpit comprises of more than one cognitive component to remember speeds:

1. Long-term memory: a library of configurations
2. Short-term memory: a specific configuration
3. Working memory: use of speed bugs on a dial
4. Deliberation: the two pilots in the cockpit

Each one of these components helps in remembering the speed of a plane by serving as an individual cognitive component in the cognitive system.

## Distributed Cognition To Social Cognition

Distributed cognition is concerned with how the mind can be extended by relations with other artifacts and other individuals.

Social cognition is concerned with distributing cognition across individuals.

## Social Cognition

Social cognition is about how social connections create systems that can, together, accomplish tasks. Social cognition is also concerned with the cognitive underpinning of social interactions themselves.

## Situated Action

Situated action is strongly concerned with the context within which people interact. However, situation action is not interested in the long-term and enduring permanent interactions amongst these things.

Situated action is interested in the kinds of novel situational problems that arise all the time. How do we find out more about these problems?

1. We must examine the interfaces we design within the context in which they're used
2. We must understand the task the user performs grows out of interaction with the interface
3. The task doesn't exist until the user gets started, and once they start, they define the task

## Situated Action And Memory

Memory is context dependent. People will often remember e.g., a list of personal tasks because it is part of a larger narrative versus remembering a list of tasks someone else gave them.

## Activity Theory

A massive and well-developed set of theories regarding interaction between various pieces of an activity. This theory predates HCI and there are some contributions of activity theory to HCI we should be aware of:

1. Activity theory generalizes our unit of analysis from the task to the activity; we're not just interested in what users doing but why users are doing it
2. Activity theory puts an emphasis on the idea that we can create low level operations from higher level actions
3. Activity theory points out that actions by the user can actually move up and down a hierarchy

## Section Quizzes

### Exercise: Distributed Cognition

_Which of the following are playing cognitive roles in the system that is paying Morgan's bills_?

1. Morgan herself
2. The pen
3. The checkbook
4. The two piles of bills
5. The bills themselves

### Reflections: Distributed Cognition

_What is the place where the system comprised of you and some number of interfaces is capable of doing more than you alone, specifically because of the qualities that the interfaces possess_?

When I am at home watching lectures or working on a project it is much easier to get things done because of how the interface is set up. I have a large 3440 x 1440 resolution monitor which mostly acts as two-three monitors. It is nice to have this interface as I can switch from one window to another very easily and makes my workflow more simple. Also, I have a monitor splitting software which allows me to arrange up to six windows on my screen which allows me to manage my windows accordingly.

### Design Challenge: Social Cognition

_How do we design a video gaming system that protects users from false perceptions_?

There should be some sort of privacy settings for the user, only certain people can see how much video games the user plays. The user should have the power to control these settings.
