# Lesson 12

In this lesson, we will cover interfaces and politics:

- **Politics** - Whether artifacts can personify specific forms of authority or power, whether good or bad

Two dimensions of politics:

1. Designing for change
2. Anticipating change from our designs

We will also touch on _value-sensitive design_.

## Change: A Third Motivation

There are three goals of HCI:

1. Help a user do a task
2. Understand how a user does a task
3. Change the way the user does a task

## Change By Design

People can design things to intentionally create a negative (designing bridges too low so that it's harder for poor people to go to a destination) or positive change (Facebook's _like_ button).

## Change By Happenstance

While people could intentionally create a positive or negative design, this could happen unintentionally as well for positive (the bicycle giving women freedom to travel independently) and negative (internet access) cases.

## Value-sensitive Design

Value-sensitive design seeks to provide theory and method to account for human values in a principled and systematic manner throughout the design process.

## Value-sensitive Design Across Cultures

One of the challenges of value-sensitive design is that values are different across cultures (culture that values privacy vs cultures that value frees speech due to censorship).

## 5 Tips: Value-sensitive Design

1. Start early
2. Know your users
3. Consider both direct and indirect stakeholder
4. Brainstorm the interface's possibilities
5. Choose carefully between supporting values and prescribing values

## Reversing The Relationship

Technology changes society but society could also change technology too (e.g., demand for single platform to link to others for TV subscriptions).

## Section Quizzes

### Design Challenge: Change By Design

_Design an app for Morgan that would encourage her to get up and move more frequently without explicitly telling her to do so._

One such app could be a social media app where users in the same city share pictures of the city. This application could encourage Morgan to go out and take pictures of the things around her.

## Reflections: Interfaces And Politics

_Think of an instance where some technology you use was designed with political motivation in mind._

When using Piazza, there is clearly a push to use their job search tool since they always push it on the landing page.
