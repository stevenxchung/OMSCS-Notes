# Lesson 21

In this lesson we will attempt to tie together all the different topics on methods and design principles.

## Designing Audiobooks For Exercisers

We will go through several iterations of the design cycles just to get to the finished product. However, just because the product is released does not mean that the design cycle ends. The design cycle starts again once real users start using our app. In a way, the design life cycle never actually ends, rather, it evolves with the product over time.

## Research Methods Meet Design Principles

Design principles capture conclusions found by the design life cycle in the past in ways that can be transferred to new tasks and new interfaces.

## Approaches To User-Centered Design

There are different approaches to user-centered design:

1. **Participatory design** - all the stakeholders including the users themselves, are involved as part of the design team but we must be careful not to over represent the few users that are participating in the design with the rest of the users out there
2. **Action research** - addresses an immediate problem and researches it by trying to simultaneously solve it
3. **Design-based research** - similar to action research but it can be done by outside practitioners as well
