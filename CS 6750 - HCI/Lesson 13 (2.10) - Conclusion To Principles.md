# Lesson 13

In this lesson, we will attempt to tie together all the different threads on design principles.

## Zooming Out: Human As Processor

At the narrowest level, we might view HCI as the interaction between a person and an interface. This view is shared by models such as the _GOMS model_.

## Zooming Out: Human As Predictor

Most of the time we are viewing HCI as the user interacting through some interface to accomplish some task. At this level we can look interactions in terms of the _gulf of execution and evaluation_. We can use tools like _cognitive task analysis_ and _hierarchical task analysis_ to understand things like user's mental models, errors, and mappings between representations and the underlying tasks.

## Zooming Out: Human As Participant

At the highest level, we are interested in how interactions occurs beyond just the individual, interface, and task. At this level we can look at interactions in terms of _activity theory_ where interactions include elements of the context surrounding the task. We could also look at how artifacts combine to accomplish a task through _distributed cognition_. Other times we can look at deeply understanding the situated context in which a person is acting through _situated action._ Additionally, we could also look at how users integrate through norms and relations with _social cognition_. There are times where we should keep in mind the intended and unintended positive and negative changes our designs might have on society during design.

## 5 Tips: On-Screen UI Design

1. Use a grid
2. Use a whitespace
3. Know your Gestalt principles
4. Reduce clutter
5. Design in grey-scale

## Only Half of the Picture

We have a lot of principles and frameworks to help us design good interfaces but that is only half of the picture. To create truly great user interfaces we must also understand our user as well as the fact that we are not our user.
